# Todo Application
This is a simple application with which we can download a list of to-do items from a fake database. In this application we can delete existing items, edit them, create and add new ones. To save changes to the to-do list and send the updated list to the database a button has been added and the necessary functionality has been implemented. Also in the application, in addition to filters, you can delete all completed to-do list items at once, as well as mark all to-do list items as completed. This application displays simple statistics on items from the to-do list. The application also includes functionality for filtering the to-do list.
